- 👋 Hi, I’m @tiagofilip
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of different skills! IEFP provides me with several modules in Python, SQL, Java, .NET and many more
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different types of projects, but Python is my favorite language to explore
- 📫 You can reach me @ tiagosampaio@mail-me.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him or they/them, whichever you prefer!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love ancient history and archeology, because of it, I know how to speak a bit of Greek! I hope to one day join both passions and help archeologists with AI!
